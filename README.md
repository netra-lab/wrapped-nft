# Wrapped Record NFT

Wrapped Record NFT is a complementary contract to Netra Music Protocol, used wrap multiple Record NFTs into one single collection. The motivation behind this creation is for collaboration with partners such as TokoMall to list Netra NFTs as a single collection. The use of this wrapped contract is only meant for trade, but hodling wrapped NFTs is discourage since royalty can't be claimed using the ownership of this contract.
