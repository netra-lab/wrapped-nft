# Wrapped Netra NFT

Wrapped Netra NFT is a complementary contract to Netra Music Protocol, used to wrap multiple Record NFTs into a single collection. The motivation behind this creation is for collaboration with partners such as TokoMall to list Netra NFTs as a single collection. The use of this wrapped contract is only meant for trade, hodling wrapped NFTs is discouraged since you cannot claim royalty using the ownership of this contract.

## Getting Started

1. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `pnpm compile` to compile and generate types.
